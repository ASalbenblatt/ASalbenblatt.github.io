      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently a sophmore at CU Boulder studying Creative Technology and
        Design Engineering, Mathematics, and Mathematics Education. When I
        graduate in the spring of 2028, I'll also be licenced to teach secondary
        math in Colorado.

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        I love to sew, cook, hike, and just make art in general in my free time.

      <h2>Intrests</h2>
      <p>
        I've always loved space, origionally going into collage for Aerospace
        Engineering. Now I've also grown to love math and Math Education, and
        will talk to anyone about it as long as they will listen.
