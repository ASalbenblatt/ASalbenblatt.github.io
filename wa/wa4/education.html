      <p>
        To me education means guiding your students on a journey of discovry
        where they not only learn the content but also learn more about
        themselves and the world all while developing skills they will use for
        the rest of their life.

        <dt>Boulder High School</dt>
        <dd>
          Here I taght with Mr. Gauthier. I went in to help out in the class
          twice a week for a total of 5 hours a week. Throughout the year, I
          taught 3 lessons entirely by myself, with two of the lessons conncting
          between two days.

        <dt>Westview Middle School</dt>
        <dd>
          Here I worked with Ms. Decker and two other CU students to observe
          three days and then teach three lessons as a team of three CU
          students.
